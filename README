= Galleries

Simple, allows you to create Galleries with Items, items have an .image which is just an asset from paperclipped.

You output a gallery within a Page of type Gallery. You can then assign a layout and a gallery to the page.

Images have assets, assets are created with paperclipped.

Allows a gallery to re-use assets by creating a new image.

Deleting an images shouldn't delete the asset (unless requested...todo etc)
